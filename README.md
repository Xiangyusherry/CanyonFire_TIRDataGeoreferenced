# CanyonFire_TIRDataGeoreferenced
Thermal Infrared (TIR) images capturing fire behavior, collected by a Matrice drone, are georeferenced to a base map with high positional accuracy (within 1 meter).

# TIR data are named after the same method as follows.
Example: 0117_0330th.tiff
in which, 0117 = the data corresponding to RGB video DJI_0117.mov; 
          0330 = the moment at the 3rd minute and 30 seconds since the RGB video 0117 started.
          th: this is TIR data. The data is RGB banded if it is named without "the"

TIR images are georeferenced with high accuracy within 1 meter.
